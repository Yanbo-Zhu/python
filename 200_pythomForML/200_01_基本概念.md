Vector  
- 1D datastructure  
- Examples: text token sequences or amino acid sequences  

Matrix  
- 2D datastructure with rows and columns:  
- Example: Black/white image, where each value is a pixel  


Tensor  
- Generalization of a matrix to more dimensions  
- Vectors and matrices are special cases  
- Example: Color image, where each pixel has three color channels  
- "arrays" in numpy are called "tensors" in torch


Array  
- Programming abstraction for tensors  
- Example: tensors implemented in Python frameworks like NumPy or Torch
