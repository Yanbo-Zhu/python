the `range` type represents a range of integers, use the `range(start, stop, step)` built-in to instantiate ranges

```
print(range(5))
print(range(0, 5))
print(range(0, 5, 1))
```

ranges are immutable, like tuples, support indexing and slicing, but do not support item assignment
```
print(range(2, 20, 3)[4])
print(range(20, 1, -2)[2:])

14
range(16, 0, -2)
```



```
my_range = range(3, 7)
my_range[2] = 2
```

you can use a sequential container type, like list, to iterate ranges to create a list of the range members
```

list(range(3, 1, -1))
会生成一个list 

```
